## :rocket: About the project

Comming Soon
<!-- This is the backend to an app for a fictional carrier, the FastFeet.

This project is part of a complete application involving backend, frontend and mobile! (See my other repositories [comming soon]) -->

## :construction_worker: Tools

The created app uses [Express](https://expressjs.com/), in addition to needing to configure the following tolls:

- Sucrase + Nodemon;
- ESLint + Prettier + EditorConfig;
- Sequelize (PostgreSQL);
- Comming Soon - [MORE TOLLS WITH THE RESOLUTION OF THE PROJECT]

## :pencil2: Functionalities

### **1. Authentication**

<!-- Allow a user to authenticate to the application using email and password

Create an administrator user using the functionality of  [seeds do sequelize](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/migrations.html#creating-first-seed), this functionality works for create records in the database in an automated way.

- The authentication must be done using JWT.
- Perform input data validation with YUP - a Javascript schema

### 2. Addressee Management

The registration of recipients can only be done by administrators authenticated in the application.

The recipient can't authenticate himself in the system, that is, he doens't have a password. -->
